# Moving_Tiles

Moving Tiles is a Game of Thrones themed grid exercise. The user will be able to hover a new character to enlarge them. When using mobile, the user can click the images to enlarge them rather than hovering. The top 2 rows and bottom 2 rows allow for one enlarged image each. 

This is a full-stack MERN application.
